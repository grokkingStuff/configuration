* Overview

Built these configuration files because I spend way too much time on my computer and I like my computer a certain way.
Also, I reinstall the os from time to time to clear up junk (hopefully the number of times I do this in the future will go down, as I'm using opensuse.)


1) Command-line tools 
   1) Install command_line_tools.txt
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      zypper install <<command_line_tools>>
      #+END_SRC
   2) Place configuration files for commandline tools
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash

      #+END_SRC
2) GUI pplications
   1) Install gui_tools.txt
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash
      zypper install <<gui_tools>>
      #+END_SRC
   2) Place configuration files for applications
      #+BEGIN_SRC bash

      #+END_SRC
3) Modify system preferences
4) Modify personal preferences
5) Add cloud services

* File management
